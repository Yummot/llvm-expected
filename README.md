## Original authors

**Most of the code in this repository is not my own work**.

The main developer of the error handling utilities is Lang Hames.
Other original contributers include Eugene Zelenko, Mehdi Amini, Torok Edwin, Chris Lattner, 
Alisdair Meredith, Daniel Dunbar, Dan Gohman and Nakamura Takumi.
